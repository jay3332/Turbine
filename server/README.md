##### Failure Responses

### Using Authorization
If an endpoint accepts authorization, you can pass in a user token as the value of
the `Authorization` header.

To generate a user token, make a request to the [Login Endpoint](#login) and grab the `token` field
of the JSON response (if everything goes well).

Some endpoints are mandatory to be authorized. In such a scenario, you will see **Authorization (Required)** in the
endpoint documentation.

##### Authorization (Required)
[See the Authorization section for more information.](#using-authorization)

Authorization is required for the server to compare the owner of the paste to the
authorized user to check whether they own the paste, and whether they are allowed
to delete the paste.

##### Successful Response
You should expect a 204 No Content status code.

##### Failure Responses
- 403 Forbidden
  - The user is not allowed to delete the paste.
